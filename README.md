# Trinity

This project was made for cs141 at UIC. The assignment was to create a game named 'Trinity'. I expanded it by creating AI to play against. 

## How to Run

Simply compile and run. 

## How to Play (printed upon running)

"Welcome to Trinity, the game where there's three ways
to get three in a row, in one of three rows or columns,
or diagonals. Play alternates between the two players.
On each move select any available piece and an open
board destination location. A winning configuration
is three of the same set in a row (e.g. b a c, A B C
or 3 2 1), all 3 from the same set position (e.g. A 1 a,
B 2 b or c 3 C), or three in a row where each is a
different set member (1st, 2nd, 3rd) such as 2 A c,
a B 3 or C 1 b."
